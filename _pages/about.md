I am a soon-to-graduate 4th year PhD student at the University of Arizona. I am broadly interested in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, my PhD thesis is on explainability and interpretability with a focus on information extraction [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00475), [2](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-demo.8/), [3](https://aclanthology.org/2022.pandl-1.1.pdf), [4](https://aclanthology.org/2022.pandl-1.10/), [5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03305)]. Outside my thesis, I worked on part-of-speech tagging [6](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.643/), representational learning [7](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.297.pdf), active learning [8](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.30.pdf), (aspect-based) sentiment analysis[[9](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06629), [10](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11979)], reaosning with LLMs and in-context learning [[11](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07544), [12](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00204)].

I am on the job market!
