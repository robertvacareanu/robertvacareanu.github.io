I am a 4th year PhD student at the University of Arizona. I am broadly interested in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, my PhD thesis is on explainability and interpretability with a focus on information extraction. Outside my thesis, I worked on representational learning, (aspect-based) sentiment analysis, reaosning with LLMs and in-context learning.

I am on the job market!
